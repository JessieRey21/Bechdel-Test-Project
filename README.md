# Bechdel-Test-Project
Final Project for DATA-2004: Data Wrangling & Visualization 
Project Goal: Tell a story about a data set from import, enrichment, cleaning, tidying, exploratory data analysis and some form of modeling. Essentially you should define a problem, use data to explore it, and make recommendations for some type of action. Use one of the following provided datasets. Each has its own strengths, weaknesses, and challenges and should highlight the data wrangling and cleaning skills you have learned through the term. They will also likely require you to further develop some skills beyond the confines of class. You will be required to locate additional data that can enrich the data you have been provided.

Chosen dataset: Bechdel test (Source: bechdeltest.com)

This was my final project for my DATA-2004 course. The Bechdel Test was created to emphasize female representation, or the lack of, in television and film. Films can score 0 - 3 on the Bechdel Test based on the following criteria 1) includes at least two named women, 2) the women must have at least one conversation and 3) the conversation must be about something other than a man. I was interested in analyzing what factors lead to lower scores on the Bechdel Test. This is important to explore because cinematography is traditionally a male profession and there is a lack of films led by and featuring women.
